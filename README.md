***How to run test***

In order to run the tests you will need Chrome Browsers, the JDK1.8, Maven. To run the test:

``` 
mvn clean verify
```

**Notes:** I have tried to use minimum features required for test automation framework. If given more time, framework and tests could be expanded to write in DSL implementation, include logger framework, test to run in selenium grid, attached test failed screenshot to cucumber report, sauce lab integration for cross browser support testing.
I don't want to spend more than 2hrs for this coding test task.
